## Projects

### SMS gateway

Documented in the [README](./SMS-gateway/README.mkd).  Send SMS to people who don't have regular internet access when they get an important email.

### Volunteer broker system

This exist as a concept only, and is a system that tackles many higher level problems a large organisation with a lot of people involved (like a council) might face.

The idea is that there are a lot of problems that require matching of tasks to people, or people to people.

The specific example is people who need help filling out a complex form getting help from willing people.

The requester needs to register that they need help in some way (SMS, phone call, online, etc) and the helper needs to be notified in some way.

Additional features could include 'on call' times, and a 'time-bank' system where helpers work a given amount of time a week and then don't get asked and more.

#### Taking this further

This is a complex problem, and a generic solution might be too hard to make.  

The project should start by 'faking' the system, getting people to do the brokerage, and then building tools to help the people.

It's worth talking to existing time-banks about this problem, and working with them where possible.

### Universal Credit pre-requisites

Filling out a Universal Credit application form might be a complex task with many pre-requisites (existing paperwork, account numbers, etc).

A set of tools (paper, online, mobile) can be made that talks someone through the task and creates a list of pre-requisites before they start filling the form out.

This is intended for two groups of users:

1. The people who need to fill out the form, to help them with the process
* The people helping others fill out the form online, where steps can be done offline to get everything ready for a potentially limited about of time online (free public internet is often limited in time and speed)

In the case where someone needs to travel to a public place like a library to fill out their claim, anything that can be done to help them fill out the form quickly and without finding out they need to get additional paperwork is vital.
